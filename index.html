                            <p class="education">I was born and raised in Roseville, California. I attempted college at
                                Trinity
                                University in San Antonio
                                and immediately dropped out in order to spend time learning to cook and bake at home.
                            </p>
                            <p class="work">I was a line cook for 4 years and worked in over 10 different restaurants in that time ranging from fast
                                food to steakhouses. I am a boring individual that spends all his free time either watching
                                food/recipe videos, working out, or complaining about literally anything to literally anybody.</p>
