            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Roseville, California. I attempted college at Trinity University in San Antonio
                and immediately dropped out in order to spend time learning to cook and bake at home.</p>
            <p>I was a line cook for 4 years and worked in over 10 different restaurants in that time ranging from fast
                food to steakhouses. I am a boring individual that spends all his free time either watching food/recipe
                videos, working out, or complaining about literally anything to literally anybody.</p>
